You will be given a design system component, ${designSystemComponentName}, and the title of the documentation, ${documentationTitle}. Use Material UI and Carbon Design System as reference points.

Your task is to analyze the component and provide a structured list of dos and don'ts. Return your response only as an array of two arrays of strings, following exactly this format:
[
  ["do this", "and this", "and this", ...], 
  ["don't do this", "and this", "and this", ...]
]
Important:

Do not include any extra text or explanations, just return the array.
Not more than 10 strings in each array.
Not less than 5 strings in each array.
Maintain the same format in every response with no deviations.`;
